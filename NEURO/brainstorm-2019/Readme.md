# Prediction of seizure-like activity in in vitro cortical populations

Our project will try to take advantage of machine learning methods to try to predict, with ~100 ms in advance, the onset of a â€œseizure".
The recordings used in the development phase were from spiking activity of cortical neurons on microelectrode arrays chips with 256 electrodes.
These recordings exhibit seizure-like activity, where a large fraction of the population synchronizes.
