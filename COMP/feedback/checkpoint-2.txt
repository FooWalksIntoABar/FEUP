CHECKPOINT 2 FEEDBACK
=====================
Class 5 - Group 51

These notes are based on an analysis of commit 874766a2189e136c608d6fb4228e97ee0518a5ba.
If you believe this is an error, contact your class teacher.
=====================

High-priority:
	- Incorrect behavior in "G51-bug_initialization.yal". This should not cause a semantic
error.
	- In "G51-bug_return.yal", the compiler complains that "f must return a value!", but f
*does* return a value.
	- In general, semantic analysis of uninitialized variables appears to be incomplete.
	- "array + array" should trigger a semantic error.
	- "g()", where g does not exist, should trigger a semantic error.
	- The only part of code generation that appears to have been started is global variable
support. Functions are not generated.

Low-priority:
	- Improve README.md file
	- Use packages, instead of Java's default package
