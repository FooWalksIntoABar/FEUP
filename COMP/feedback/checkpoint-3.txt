=====================
Class 1 - Group 51

These notes are based on an analysis of commit 4f7a17637f4982de598946a6247539768af1b7a5.
If you believe this is an error, contact your class teacher.
=====================

High-priority:
	- "call-main.yal": NullPointerException at SymbolTable.getParameters
	- "getstatic"/"putstatic" instructions are missing a whitespace before the variable name,
and type signature appears as "Unknown".
	- "constant-ranges.yal": NullPointerException at SymbolTable.setLineNumbers
	- "nested-branch.yal": Appears to use "getstatic"/"putstatic" in example where all variables
are local.

Low-priority:
	- Prefer the use of compact instructions whenever possible (e.g., "iload_0" instead of
"iload 0").
