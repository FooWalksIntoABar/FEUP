## Iteration 1
In this update we introduce the core appearence and funtionality of the various screens related to the Child user interface.  
The objective was just to nail the general look, which was achieved and approved.

## Iteration 2
In this update the objective was to ensure the application's back end was correctly structured whilst ensuring the project owners could observe visual progress.  
Therefore, both Django server and CI/CD got major progress and simultaneously the newly refined application look was praised.

## Iteration 3
In this update, several enhancements were made mainly on the topic of creating a custom activity, child area look and application flow.  
By closing this sprint, the child area nears its completion and most likely will only receive minor updates. Therefore, the team will now focus on the parent area for the next iteration.  
The backend server also received a major update and appears to be fully functional.
