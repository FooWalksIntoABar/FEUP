# FEUP

Repository to host various projects for the FEUP course.

### [AEDA/APlaceInTheSun](https://github.com/afonsobspinto/FEUP/tree/master/AEDA/APlaceInTheSun)

A supermarket chain wants to innovate and let its customers purchase over the Internet. 
To monetize the service, the supermarket tries to group the largest number of purchases in a single trip.
Also, both Exact search, as well as approximate search, of the strings identifying the names of the Streets and supermarkets are implemented.

### [LBAW/Online Auctions](https://github.com/afonsobspinto/FEUP/tree/master/LBAW)
It is intended to develop an information system with a web interface to support an online auction service. Any registered user can place items up for auction or bid on items available. The system should automatically manage the bidding deadlines and determine the winning bid. System managers are allowed to stop auction block accounts or delete content.

### [LCOM/ChessProject](https://github.com/afonsobspinto/FEUP/tree/master/LCOM)
 ChessProject is the final project that combines all the exercises performed during the semester. This is a two-user chess game developed for the Minix 3.1.8 operating system.

### [LPOO/Dungeon Keep](https://github.com/afonsobspinto/FEUP/tree/master/LPOO/Dungeon%20Keep) 
"Unfairly captured by the tyrant ruler of your Realm, you have been thrown into a dark, damp and ghastly dungeon, left there to rot into forgetfulness... You keep yelling for the Guard, but he seems oblivious to your calls...You need to escape...wait...but...in the midst of all the fuss that was your capture, they forgot to lock your cell door...there is hope...but the task is not simple...will you have it in you to elude your jailers and make your way back to freedom?"

### [LPOO/SuperSlimeFootball](https://github.com/afonsobspinto/FEUP/tree/master/LPOO/SuperSlimeSoccer)

### [PLOG/Optimization](https://github.com/afonsobspinto/FEUP/tree/master/PLOG/Optimization)
Modeling a teaching service distribution as a optimization problem using constraint logic programming.

### [PLOG/RacingKings](https://github.com/afonsobspinto/FEUP/tree/master/PLOG/RacingKings)
Modeling a popular chess variant, [Racing Kings](https://lichess.org/variant/racingKings), using logical programming.

### [PROG/Supermaket++](https://github.com/afonsobspinto/FEUP/tree/master/PROG/Supermaket++)
Supermarket Management System
	
### [RCOM/File Transfer](https://github.com/afonsobspinto/FEUP/tree/master/RCOM/File%20Transfer)
Implementation of a communication protocol for transmitting files through the serial port RS-232.

### [RCOM/FTP Client](https://github.com/afonsobspinto/FEUP/tree/master/RCOM/FTP%20Client)
Development of an FTP download application.

### [SDIS/Distributed Backup Service](https://github.com/afonsobspinto/FEUP/tree/master/SDIS/distributed%20backup%20service) 
The idea is to use the free disk space of the computers in a LAN for backing up files in other computers in the same LAN. The service is provided by servers in an environment that is assumed cooperative (rather than hostile). Nevertheless, each server retains control over its own disks and, if needed, may reclaim the space it made available for backing up other computers' files.

### [SDIS/Raft](https://github.com/afonsobspinto/FEUP/tree/master/SDIS/raft) 
Raft is a consensus algorithm that is designed to be easy to understand. It's equivalent to Paxos in fault-tolerance and performance. The difference is that it's decomposed into relatively independent subproblems, and it cleanly addresses all major pieces needed for practical systems. We hope Raft will make consensus available to a wider audience, and that this wider audience will be able to develop a variety of higher quality consensus-based systems than are available today.

### [SOPE/Sauna](https://github.com/afonsobspinto/FEUP/tree/master/SOPE/sauna) 
Simulation of access to shared resources: Saunas Manager

### [SOPE/Sfind](https://github.com/afonsobspinto/FEUP/tree/master/SOPE/sfind)
Simplified version of find command

# Engineers, Unite!
A renowned FEUP teacher’s evil twin, jealous of his brothers’ stardom, has infiltrated the university’s secret control room and pulled a lever which stacks every room in the building on top of eachother in an attempt to disrupt the college. 
A group of three students take matters into their hands. Enriched with knowledge from FEUP’s different masters, combine special abilities to traverse through the rooms’ obstacles and hazards the evil twin has carefully placed.  
**Reach the top of the tower and restore order to the university.**

</p>

A quick video trailer was made available on [**YouTube**](https://youtu.be/Jb8YH89phiI).

## How to play
You will control students from FEUP, each from a different master course and with a special ability. Traverse through the classroom’s obstacles and combine their special abilities to exit the room.

### Informatics student
Represented in **red**, he hacks the tower's security mainframe, disabling every fire hazard on the level.

### Chemistry student
Represented in **yellow**, she performs a chemical reaction pushing every surrounding student away from her.

### Civil student
Represented in **green**, he equips a hard hat on his head, allowing others to step on his head to reach higher grounds.

### Pause mechanic
The engineering council scattered their patented **time freezing coins** across the levels to aid you on the evil twin's challenges. Consume a time coin and freeze the selected student.

## Keybindings
**[WASD]** - Movement  
**[R]** - Restart level  
**[C]** - Switch character  
**[V]** - Switch character (inverted)  
**[T]** - Stop/Restart time (only available after getting the time power up)  
**[X]** - Trigger ability from active student (only once)  
**[Z]** - Restart time and trigger chemistry ability simultaneously  

## Installation instructions
1. Download the game [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OX8ffoSk0Gglx6kyIm-KT8QCv9HjZ8Ke/view?usp=sharing) (Windows);
2. Unzip the downloaded folder;
3. Run the 'EngineersUnite' application.

## Development process
We followed a [Rapid Application Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_application_development) paradigma which allowed us to  write the game much faster, and made it easier to change requirements on the fly.

### The puzzle platformer genre
*Engineers, Unite!* is heavily based on level design (as most puzzle games are), which means we had a prototype which included every mechanic setup fairly quickly and all we needed to do from then-on would be creating extra levels whilst making slight modifications to each ability to ensure no level is exploited and room's difficulty curve was adequate.  
**This meant we could secure a functioning final product fairly early and dedicate the final weeks to polish.**

### The polish section
With the extra time, we were able to implement 18 unique levels with rising difficulty, a death count, visual feedback on ability activation, timeouts before each death/level complete and even a final level which nicely ties with the storyline.

## Resources used
### Game Engine
*Engineers, Unite!* was fully developed on [**Unity**](https://unity.com/) free edition across 2018.3 versions. The last being **2018.3.9f1**.
