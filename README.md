# Engineers, Unite!

## The premise
A renowned FEUP teacher’s evil twin, jealous of his brothers’ stardom, has infiltrated the university’s secret control room and pulled a lever which stacks every room in the building on top of eachother in an attempt to disrupt the college. 
A group of three students take matters into their hands. Enriched with knowledge from FEUP’s different masters, combine special abilities to traverse through the rooms’ obstacles and hazards the evil twin has carefully placed.  
**Reach the top of the tower and restore order to the university.**

## How to play
You will control students from FEUP, each from a different master course and with a special ability. Traverse through the classroom’s obstacles and combine their special abilities to exit the room.

### Informatics student
Represented in **red**, he hacks the tower's security mainframe, disabling every fire hazard on the level.

### Chemistry student
Represented in **yellow**, she performs a chemical reaction pushing every surrounding student away from her.

### Civil student
Represented in **green**, he equips a hard hat on his head, allowing others to step on his head to reach higher grounds.

### Pause mechanic
The engineering council scattered their patented **time freezing coins** across the levels to aid you on the evil twin's challenges. Consume a time coin and freeze the selected student.

## Installation instructions
1. Download the game [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OX8ffoSk0Gglx6kyIm-KT8QCv9HjZ8Ke/view?usp=sharing) (Windows);

## Development process
We followed a [Rapid Application Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_application_development) paradigma which allowed us to  write the game much faster, and made it easier to change requirements on the fly.

### The puzzle platformer genre
*Engineers, Unite!* is heavily based on level design (as most puzzle games are), which means we had a prototype which included every mechanic setup fairly quickly and all we needed to do from then-on would be creating extra levels whilst making slight modifications to each ability to ensure no level is exploited and room's difficulty curve was adequate.  
**This meant we could secure a functioning final product fairly early and dedicate the final weeks to polish.**

### The polish section
With the extra time, we were able to implement 18 unique levels with rising difficulty, a death count, visual feedback on ability activation, timeouts before each death/level complete and even a final level which nicely ties with the storyline.
