# Engineers, Unite!

## The premise
A renowned FEUP teacher’s evil twin, jealous of his brothers’ stardom, has infiltrated the university’s secret control room and pulled a lever which stacks every room in the building on top of eachother in an attempt to disrupt the college. 
A group of three students take matters into their hands. Enriched with knowledge from FEUP’s different masters, combine special abilities to traverse through the rooms’ obstacles and hazards the evil twin has carefully placed. As long as one student reaches the exit, the level is completed. Reach the top of the tower and restore order to the university.

## How to play
You will control students from FEUP, each from a certain master course and with a special ability. Traverse through the classroom’s obstacles and use their abilities to reach the exit door. The abilities:
Informatics - Codes on the computer to stop the fire
Chemistry - Explodes to help the others students reach unreachable places
Civil - Places a helmet on his head to help the other students reach higher places
You can also collect a time pause power-up where you can freeze one of the students when used.
