# Engineers, Unite!

## The premise
A renowned FEUP teacher’s evil twin, jealous of his brothers’ stardom, has infiltrated the university’s secret control room and pulled a lever which stacks every room in the building on top of eachother in an attempt to disrupt the college. 
A group of three students take matters into their hands. Enriched with knowledge from FEUP’s different masters, combine special abilities to traverse through the rooms’ obstacles and hazards the evil twin has carefully placed.  
**Reach the top of the tower and restore order to the university.**

## How to play
You will control students from FEUP, each from a different master course and with a special ability. Traverse through the classroom’s obstacles and combine their special abilities to exit the room.

### Informatics student
Represented in **red**, he hacks the tower's security mainframe, disabling every fire hazard on the level.

### Chemistry student
Represented in **yellow**, she performs a chemical reaction pushing every surrounding student away from her.

### Civil student
Represented in **green**, he equips a hard hat on his head, allowing others to step on his head to reach higher grounds.

### Pause mechanic
The engineering council scattered their patented **time freezing coins** across the levels to aid you on the evil twin's challenges. Consume a time coin and freeze the selected student.
