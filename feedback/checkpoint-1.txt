=====================

High-priority:
	- Error Recovery is incomplete: see aval4_err.yal
	- Tree Annotation is incomplete:
		- For instance, the <ID>s of Function() and FunctionAssign() are not stored.

Low-priority:
	- Use packages, instead of Java's default package
	- Stop after the first 10 parser errors
	- Consider outputting "prettier" (i.e., cleaner and more informative) error messages.
	- Consider rewriting the grammar to avoid use of LOOKAHEADs.
