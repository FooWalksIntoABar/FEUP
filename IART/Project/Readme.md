### E2: Application of ID3 or C4.5 to the identification of Pulsars

#### GOal

From a set of examples, it is possible to learn (or derive) the classification rules for the domain under analysis. The goal of this project is to determine the decision tree that translates these rules into predicting Pulsars identification.

#### Description

A set of examples (samples) are used in learning the classification rules for the elements (population) of the domain under analysis. The elements of the domain are defined by a set of attributes (or variables), which will constitute the parameters of the classification rules to derive after the learning process. A very important first step is to identify the attributes that best define the domain under analysis.

The program should apply the ID3 / C4.5 algorithm to, based on the data set available here, determine a Decision Tree that translates the classification rules of this data set. The data set must be carefully analyzed in order to verify the possible need for pre-processing. The model obtained must then be used in the classification of new cases.

The project includes the following procedures:

    Implementation / application of algorithm ID3 / C4.5.

    Presentation of classification rules, which are taken from the resulting Decision Tree.

    Detailed measurement of results in training and test data.
